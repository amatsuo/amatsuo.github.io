This study discusses a downside of electoral pressure. As elections approach, legislators reduce their effort in legislative activities, albeit while increasing their efficiency. To show this, we propose a new, natural experimental design exploiting staggered legislative election calendars to identify the effect of approaching elections. Two-way natural blocking improves the balance of pretreatments and an instrumental variable approach addresses noncompliance by retirees. Our analysis of the Japanese House of Councillors demonstrates that legislators up for election show up in the chamber less often than those not facing election; however, when they do show up and speak, they tend to speak longer.

This article explains what determine the amount of speeches delivered by Japanese Lower House members at standing committees.  The literature has considered committees as merely obstacles to pass legislations or as an &ldquo;arena&rdquo; for debates only for partisan purposes.  This article argues that individual members' motivations are also important: members use speeches as opportunities for improving electoral fortunes, getting promotion in their party, and influencing policy by exerting their expertise.  To support this argument, the authors parse conference minutes in the 1980s and 2000s using Perl scripts and compile an original dataset on the amount of committee speeches given by individual House members.  The analyses show that there are three important determinants of speech amounts, which are members' electoral interests, policy expertise of each member, and partisan politics.  In addition, comparison between two decades suggests the changing pattern of members' speeches after the electoral reform in 1994.

&ldquo;Decomposing Political Knowledge.&rdquo; (with Seonghui Lee, Invited for Revise and Resubmit) <!--<span class='cl'  id="wp1cl">[Abstract]</span>-->
<!--<div class="abstract" id='wp1abst'>Although political knowledge has been conceptually defined with two constructs &mdash; accuracy and confidence in factual information &mdash; the conventional measurement of political knowledge employed in previous research has heavily relied on recall accuracy than the other. Lacking the attempt to measure confidence in knowledge results in our inability to rigorously identify different types of political informedness, such as misinformation. This article theoretically explores these two constructs of knowledge and argues that each construct has unique antecedents and behavior consequences. We suggest a survey instrument for confidence in knowledge and introduce a method to estimate latent traits of recall accuracy and confidence separately. Fully considering the two dimensions of political knowledge, we find that misinformed citizens are as much engaged in politics as the well-informed, but, their active involvement do not guarantee informed political choices. Our findings warrant the further theoretical and empirical exploration of the confidence in political knowledge. </div>-->
