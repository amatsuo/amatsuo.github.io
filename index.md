I am Research Fellow in Data Science in [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk). I earned my Ph.D in [political science](https://politicalscience.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) in 2012. I was a research officer in Department of Methodology at LSE, and before joining LSE, I was a part of [Nuffield Centre for Experimental Social Sciences](https://cess-web.nuff.ox.ac.uk) at University of Oxford as a postdoc officer.

My research interests lie in the fields of quantitative methodology and politics. In particular, I am interested in the statistical methodology for latent scaling of survey responses and legislative speeches, content analysis of large corpus of texts (e.g. social media texts, open-ended survey answers, and parliamentary speeches), and causal identification in legislative behavior.
