I am Research Fellow in Data Science at  [Department of Methodology](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/methodologyInstitute/Home.aspx) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk). I earned my Ph.D in political science at Rice University in 2012 and moved to United Kingdom. I used to be at [Nuffield Centre for Experimental Social Sciences](https://cess-web.nuff.ox.ac.uk) as a postdoc officer.

My research interests lie in the fields of quantitative methodology and politics. In particular, I am interested in the statistical methodology for causal identification, latent scaling with Bayesian inferences, and content analysis of large corpus of texts (e.g. social media texts, parliamentary speeches).
