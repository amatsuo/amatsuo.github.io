I am a Lectuer in the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). Prior to my current position, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/institute-for-analytics-and-data-science). Before joining Essex,
I was a Research Fellow in Data Science in the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk). I earned my Ph.D in [political science](https://politicalscience.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) in 2012.

My research interests lie in data science and politics. In particular, I am interested in the statistical methodology for scaling political behavior and natural language processing of political texts, such as social media texts, government documents, and parliamentary speeches.
