I am Research Fellow in Data Science in [Department of Methodology](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/methodologyInstitute/Home.aspx) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk). I earned my Ph.D in [political science](https://politicalscience.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) in 2012. I was a research officer in [Department of Methodology](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/methodologyInstitute/Home.aspx) at LSE, and before joining LSE, I was a part of [Nuffield Centre for Experimental Social Sciences](https://cess-web.nuff.ox.ac.uk) at University of Oxford as a postdoc officer.

My research interests lie in the fields of quantitative methodology and politics. In particular, I am interested in the statistical methodology for causal identification in legislative behavior, latent scaling of survey answers and legislative speeches, and content analysis of large corpus of texts (e.g. social media texts, parliamentary speeches).
